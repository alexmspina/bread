## Process
1. Initial Mix: In bowl combine milk (100g), egg, starter, sugar, yeast, tangzhong, and flour (470g). Mix to shaggy.
2. Rest: 15–20 minute rest (hydration & initial gluten).
3. Add Salt: Mix until salt fully incorporated; moderate gluten develops.
4. Incorporate Butter: Add softened butter in 2–3 additions; knead until smooth, elastic, fine windowpane.
5. Bulk Fermentation: 2–3 hours at ~79°F until ~60–70% rise.
6. Divide (optional): Split into 3–4 pieces; pre-shape rounds; rest 10–15 minutes.
7. Final Shape: Roll each into oval; coil/roll tightly; place seam-down in greased pan.
8. Proof: 1.5–2.5 hours at ~82°F until 1–2 cm above rim (or near lid height).
9. Bake: 374°F for 30–35 minutes; tent if browning early. Internal temp 199–203°F.
10. Cool: Remove from pan; cool at least 2 hours.

## Notes
- Yeast added up front for predictable rise; starter for flavor complexity.
- Tangzhong boosts softness and shelf life.
- Thorough butter incorporation = finer, shreddable crumb.
