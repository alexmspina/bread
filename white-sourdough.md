# White Sourdough

A standard lean sourdough for a crusty, open-crumb hearth loaf.

## Formula

| Ingredient | Weight (g) | Baker's % (Flour Basis 500g) |
|------------|------------|------------------------------|
| White Bread Flour | 450 | 90% |
| Whole Wheat Flour | 50 | 10% |
| Water (total) | 400 | 80% |
| Active Sourdough Starter (100% hydration) | 100 | 20% |
| Kosher Salt | 10 | 2% |

Total Flour (excludes flour in starter for this % system): 500g  
Overall Hydration (excluding starter water): 80%  
True Hydration (including starter’s 50g water & 50g flour): (400 + 50) / (500 + 50) = 81.8%  
Total Formula Weight: 1010g

## Process
1. Mix & Autolyze: Combine flours + 375g water. Rest 45–60 minutes.
2. Add Starter: Incorporate 100g active starter; mix until moderately developed.
3. Add Salt + Remaining Water: Add 10g salt and the final 25g water. Pinch/fold until fully absorbed.
4. Bulk Fermentation: 2.5–4 hours at 75–78°F. Perform 2–3 stretch & folds early; then let rise ~50–60%.
5. Pre-shape: Lightly round; bench rest 25 minutes.
6. Final Shape: Shape boule or batard; place seam-up in floured banneton.
7. Final Rise: Room temperature 1–2 hours (poke test: slow spring, slight dent remains).
8. Preheat: Dutch oven + oven at 500°F for at least 1 hour.
9. Load & Score: Invert onto parchment (seam down), place into hot Dutch oven, score immediately.
10. Bake: 23 minutes covered at 450°F, then 23 minutes uncovered at 450°F to deep brown.
11. Cool: Minimum 2 hours on rack before slicing.

## Notes
- No cold retard: cleaner, mild acidity profile.
- Extend bulk (not final proof) if dough is underdeveloped.
- For lighter crust color, reduce uncovered time slightly or vent lid last 5 minutes.
